# ti-fs

> **IMPORTANT: ** This is highly experimental and incomplete. Currently this is being used solely with [triple](https://github.com/tonylukasavage/triple), but I'll happily take PRs for additional functionality.

node.js-style `fs` for Titanium. It can serve as a drop-in replacement for node.js `console` for use with [browserify][].

## install

```bash
$ npm install ti-fs
$ cp node_modules/ti-fs/ti-fs.js /path/to/project/Resources/
```
